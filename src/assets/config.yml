# Merge behavior for applying properties
# Options are:
#   - soft:  Only change properties if they are set to their default values.
#            This is the default behavior because it preserves changes to properties
#            that users have manually configured. If there is no default value
#            for a given property, then it is treated as if the current value
#            is its default value.
#   - hard:  Change all properties not explicitly excluded
#   - force: Change all propertiess
merge: "soft"

# List of properties to exclude when applying profiles. Each entry is a
# regular expression on the fully qualified name of the property
#
# Example:
#   exclude:
#     - "^xsettings/Net/ThemeName$" # Specific property
#     - "^xsettings/Net"            # Everything starting with /Net in the xsettings channel
#     - "^xfwm4"                    # Everything in the xfwm4 channel
#     - "mycustomname"              # Everything containing the string "mycustomname"
exclude: []
