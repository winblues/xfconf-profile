# Merge behavior for applying properties
# Options are:
#   - soft:  Only change properties if they are set to their default values.
#            This is the default behavior as it preserves changes to properties
#            that users have manually configured.
#   - hard:  Change all properties not explicitly excluded
#   - force: Change all propertiess
